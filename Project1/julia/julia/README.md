To run the code, please install Julia from julialang.org.
Once installed, open the REPL and install Pluto.jl:

`import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")`

Once Pluto.jl is installed, you may run it:

`import Pluto; Pluto.run()`

Then input the path of the notebook Julia file. Pluto.jl will
automatically handle installing any libraries necessary for
running the project code.

You may also view the included HTML document, but the best way
of viewing the code is through Pluto.jl since it enables
interactivity.
